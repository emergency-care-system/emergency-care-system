# Maintainers and access continuity

This file is the roster, and the honest answer to the question a professional
evaluation asks about any dependency: *what happens if the person who can ship a
fix is unavailable?*

It is deliberately not aspirational. Everything below describes the project as it
is on the day you read it in git history, not a structure the project hopes to
grow into.

## Roster

| Person               | GitHub                                                       | Email                                                       | Role              | Since      |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------- |
| Joel Parker Henderson | [@joelparkerhenderson](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson) | <joel@joelparkerhenderson.com> | Maintainer (sole) | 2025-08-09 |

**The bus factor of this project is one.** There is exactly one person with write
access to the repositories, one person who can publish a release, and one person
who can accept a pull request. No second maintainer exists, no organisation
stands behind the project, and no legal entity is a party to it. The
`LilyDesignSystem` GitHub organisation is an organisational convenience owned by
that same person; it does not represent a group.

Everything else in this file follows from that sentence, and no wording elsewhere
in the repository should be read as softening it.

## Scale, and what one maintainer means at this scale

Lily is unusually large for a one-person project: 491 catalog components
implemented across seven frameworks, seven example applications, 35 helper
packages, 45 theme stylesheets, and roughly 11,000 markdown files. State that
plainly rather than let a reader discover it as a surprise.

The practical consequences:

- **Review depth is one person's.** Machine gates (`bin/test`, `bin/check-links`,
  the per-framework suites, axe-core, Playwright) stand in for the review capacity
  a larger team would have. See [AI_STATEMENT.md](AI_STATEMENT.md) §7.
- **Coverage is uneven and says so.** Some claims are verified point-in-time
  snapshots rather than live guarantees; [spec/index.md](spec/index.md) §11.4
  labels them as such, and §11.8 lists what is genuinely open.
- **Response time is not committed.** There is no support SLA, paid or otherwise.

## Publishing identities and where they live

These are the credentials and configured identities that can put bytes in front of
a user. Naming them is the point: an inventory nobody has written down is an
inventory nobody can hand over.

| Identity | What it publishes | Held by | Recovery if the holder is unavailable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GitHub account `joelparkerhenderson` and the `LilyDesignSystem` organisation | every repository, every release, issues, settings, and the `lilydesignsystem.github.io` Pages site | the maintainer | none: GitHub's account-recovery process is the only route, and it is between GitHub and the account holder |
| npm publish rights | the published headless and helper packages | the maintainer's npm account (plus `NPM_TOKEN` as a CI secret; slated for OIDC [Trusted Publishing](https://github.com/LilyDesignSystem/lily-design-system/blob/main/spec/trusted-publishing/index.md) when all forges are covered) | the npm owner list is the recovery surface, and it is that one account |
| NuGet publish rights | the Blazor headless library plus the 5 Blazor helper packages (published 2026-09-02: `LilyDesignSystem.Blazor.Headless` 0.1.1, `.ThemePicker`/`.LocalePicker`/`.TextSizePicker`/`.SharePicker`/`.DateTimePicker` 0.1.0) | OIDC [Trusted Publishing](https://github.com/LilyDesignSystem/lily-design-system/blob/main/spec/trusted-publishing/index.md) from GitHub Actions only (a nuget.org policy bound to this repo's `publish.yml`, keyed to the maintainer's nuget.org profile via the `NUGET_USER` CI secret — no long-lived NuGet API key exists) | the nuget.org account holding the trusted-publisher policy is the recovery surface; GitLab and Codeberg still cannot publish to NuGet at all |
| GitLab and Codeberg mirrors | a full push mirror of every subtree | the maintainer | see "If the maintainer is unavailable" — this is the one identity that meaningfully reduces risk |
| The Lily™ and Lily Design System™ marks | the project name | the maintainer, personally | trademark rights do not transfer with a fork; see [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) |

**The honest reading of that table:** every publishing identity terminates at one
person's account. Nothing here is escrowed, and no mitigation is currently
available to a one-person project without a legal entity behind it.

## If the maintainer is unavailable

There is no succession plan that a document can create. What exists instead:

- **Nothing already published disappears.** Published npm versions are immutable
  (they can be deprecated, which needs the owner anyway); GitHub releases stay
  downloadable; the Pages site keeps serving. An application already depending on
  a pinned version is not affected by maintainer availability.
- **Nothing new ships.** No release, no accessibility fix, no new framework, no
  security patch.
- **The work is not lost, and this part is unusually well covered.** Every
  subproject is a `git subtree` pushed to three independent forges — GitHub,
  GitLab, and Codeberg (see each subproject's `.git-subtree-push`). The whole
  history survives the loss of any one of them, including GitHub. The license is
  a permissive menu ([LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md)) and the entire design rationale is
  in the tree under [spec/](spec/index.md) rather than in one person's head. A
  fork is a complete and legitimate continuation, and the project's position is
  that it should be taken rather than waited on.
- **What a fork must rename.** The marks. Everything else carries over.

If you depend on Lily in production and that position is not acceptable to you
(it reasonably may not be), the mitigation is on your side of the boundary: pin a
version, vendor the components you use — Lily is designed to be copied, and the
website's quick start leads with copying markup rather than installing anything —
and budget for maintaining it. That is a truthful answer, and it is more useful
than a continuity plan with nobody behind it.

## Adding a maintainer

The project wants this and has no process theatre around it. The route is
ordinary: contribute, sustain it, and ask. What earns the row is demonstrated
judgement about the contracts in [spec/](spec/index.md) — the accessibility
contract, the headless boundary, cross-framework parity — because those are what
a maintainer is being trusted with.

When someone takes that route, this file gains a row, [CODEOWNERS](CODEOWNERS)
gains their handle on the areas they own, and the table above gains a second
holder wherever the identity permits one. Those three edits are the whole
mechanism.

## Contact

- General, and anything in this file: <joel@joelparkerhenderson.com>
- Bugs and feature requests: the issue tracker on
  [GitHub](https://github.com/LilyDesignSystem/lily-design-system/)
- Security-sensitive reports: email rather than the tracker, and say so in the
  subject line. There is no separate security team; the maintainer is the whole
  path.
